## Tutorial 

I've uploaded a `.zip` file that includes three photos downloaded via Google Takeout. To test the program, you can `cd` into this directory and execute: 

		`python3 -m photoGeoExtractor extract-metadata --input=./photoGeoExtractor_sample_imgs.zip --output=./photoGeoExtractor_sample_imgs.csv`

An example of the output generated is also in this directory at `example_photoGeoExtractor_sample_imgs.csv`.
